"""Tee mirroring: feed re-uploading mirrors from the upload stream itself.

A mirror that cannot take a server-side copy (a Discord store on either
side, another backend, ``mode: reupload``) has to receive every byte of
a version through this process. Today those bytes are read back from
the primary store after the upload, or from the local cache when one
is configured. With ``sync: tee`` the client's upload stream is split
instead: the primary store consumes it as it always did, and every
byte it takes is handed to one bounded buffer per such mirror, whose
upload runs at the same time. Nothing is read back and nothing touches
the disk; the price is that the client's upload runs at the pace of the
slowest store, since a full buffer makes the primary's next read wait.

The pieces:

* :class:`TeeBranch` is one buffer: the producer ``feed``\\s chunks and
  waits while the branch holds ``capacity`` bytes; the consumer takes
  them off through ``stream``. ``finish`` marks the end of the bytes,
  ``detach`` drops the branch when its mirror failed so the producer is
  never held up by a consumer that is gone.
* :class:`TeeFileMessage` wraps the message the primary uploader reads
  and feeds every branch as a side effect of ``read``. The end of the
  stream is signalled by the byte count, not by ``close``: the Telegram
  uploader closes the message after every part.
* :class:`TeeUpload` bundles the wrapped message with the mirror upload
  tasks and collects their replicas once the primary is done.

Encryption sits above the repository, so the branches carry exactly
what the primary receives: ciphertext when encryption is on.
