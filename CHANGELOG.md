# Changelog

All notable changes to tgdcfs are documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/),
and this project adheres to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/spec/v2.0.0.html).
While the version is below 1.0.0, a minor release may change behaviour or
configuration defaults; such changes are listed under **Changed** and marked
as breaking where an existing setup needs attention.

Every release is a Git tag `vX.Y.Z` with a matching
[GitHub release](https://github.com/Xyvran/tgdcfs/releases), and the Docker
images `xyvran/tgdcfs` and `xyvran/tgdcfs-fe` carry the tags `X.Y.Z` and `X.Y`
next to the commit tag. Releases up to and including 0.6.1 were tagged after
the fact on the commits that shipped them.

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- This changelog, SemVer release tags and GitHub releases. A pushed tag
  `vX.Y.Z` publishes the release notes from this file and adds the version
  tags to the Docker images of that commit.

## [0.6.1] - 2026-10-04

### Changed

- When the local cache refuses an entry, the log now says why: which limit is
  hit (`max_size_mb`, `max_files` or the `min_free_mb` disk headroom) with the
  figures, and what holds the rest (pinned entries, entries being written, or
  a disk filled by something outside the cache). The messages read
  `Cache: not caching …`, `… is only partly cached: …` and
  `… is read without the cache: …`.

### Fixed

- A client that hangs up while its request body is being read is no longer
  logged as "Exception in ASGI application" with a traceback; it is logged at
  debug level only.

## [0.6.0] - 2026-09-28

### Added

- `sync: tee` for file systems with mirrors that re-upload (Discord on either
  side, another backend, or `mode: reupload`). The client's upload stream is
  split: the primary consumes it as before and each such mirror uploads the
  same bytes at the same time, without reading them back from the primary and
  without touching the disk. A write lasts as long as the slowest store. A
  mirror that fails mid-stream is detached and backfilled later; a failing
  primary aborts the mirrors. Mirrors that copy server-side are still
  forwarded afterwards.
- `tgdcfs.transfer.tee_buffer_mb` (default `64`): buffer per mirror in tee
  mode.
- Config generator: "Tee" in the Sync select, a "Tee Buffer per Mirror (MB)"
  field, and an on/off switch for the Telegram section like the Discord one,
  so a Discord-only config can be built from the form.

### Changed

- `sync: tee` is refused together with `strict: true` or `write_ack: cache`.
- Discord uploads read a part only once an upload slot is free, so a source
  faster than Discord is held back instead of being buffered whole in memory.
- `backends.discord.max_concurrent_uploads` now defaults to one part per bot,
  at least 3, so every configured bot stays busy.

## [0.5.1] - 2026-09-27

### Fixed

- Discord stores with several bot tokens: editing a message (the mirrored
  file descriptor) went to the next bot of the round-robin and failed with
  403 / error 50005 almost every time, leaving stale descriptor copies in
  Discord mirrors. Edits now go to the bot that sent the message; a message
  whose sender is no longer configured is replaced by a fresh one.
- Listing a folder with thousands of files blocked the event loop for 10 to
  27 seconds per PROPFIND (and made Discord bots miss their heartbeats). File
  lookups by name in a folder are now constant-time.

## [0.5.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Config generator: "Load Existing config.yaml" reads a config back into the
  form, both the current layout and the tgfs layout, and lists keys the form
  has no field for instead of dropping them silently.
- Config generator: a Docker panel with the `docker run` command and a
  downloadable `docker-compose.yml` for the config at hand (ports, data
  volume, passphrase variable from a `.env` file).
- Config generator: a read-only checkbox for users.

### Changed

- Read cache: large files are now cached block by block as they are read.
  Previously a version had to pass `max_file_size_mb`, fit the whole budget
  and leave the disk headroom before a single block was cached, so large
  files were never cached at all. `max_file_size_mb` now limits only what is
  staged whole (uploads and mirror downloads).

## [0.4.1] - 2026-09-26

### Fixed

- A PROPFIND on encrypted files left one empty read-cache entry per listed
  file. They cost no budget, but piled up without a `max_files` limit, could
  evict real content, and their sparse files made a plain `tar` of the data
  directory as large as every file listed.
- `MKCOL` and `PUT` directly below the WebDAV root (outside every configured
  file system) failed with 500. They now answer 403, and a `PUT` whose parent
  folder does not exist answers 409, as RFC 4918 requires. Upload tools such
  as rclone and tgsaver now get a proper answer.

## [0.4.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- Local cache on the data volume (`tgdcfs.cache`, off by default). It holds
  ciphertext only and never fails a transfer: a disk error or a full cache
  means the transfer runs without it.
  - Staged uploads (`stage_uploads`): mirrors that re-upload read the bytes
    from the cache instead of downloading them from the primary again.
  - Read cache (`keep_for_reads`): repeated reads are served from disk, filled
    block by block (`block_kb`).
  - Budget and limits: `max_size_mb` (default 20480) is a hard ceiling,
    `max_files`, `max_file_size_mb`, and `min_free_mb` (default 1024) keeps
    free disk space for everything else in the data directory.
  - A background sweep every 15 minutes and at start removes orphans, releases
    stale pins, drops entries unread for `max_age_hours` (default 0, off) and
    evicts down to `target_fill_percent` (default 90) of the budget.
- Write-back uploads per file system (`write_ack: cache`, default `primary`):
  a PUT is answered once the bytes are in the local cache, and a worker
  distributes them to the primary and every mirror in parallel. Requires
  `cache.enabled`, refused with `strict: true`. Until the primary has the
  file, it exists only on the local disk.
- Multi-source downloads per file system (`read_parallel`, default off;
  `read_sources` to limit the stores): a download is split into pieces served
  by every store that holds a complete copy, with per-piece failover.
- `tgdcfs.transfer.upload_parts_in_flight` (default 1): upload several
  Telegram parts at once from a seekable source such as the cache.
- `tgdcfs.transfer.read_parallel_window`: reorder window for multi-source
  reads.
- Manager API: `GET /api/cache` (budget, entries, hits and misses, free disk
  space, last sweep) and `POST /api/cache/evict`. The mini app shows the cache
  in the "Mirrors and replication" dialog.
- Config generator: a "Local Cache" section and the per-file-system fields
  `write_ack`, `read_parallel` and `read_sources`. Only values that differ
  from the defaults are written.

## [0.3.0] - 2026-09-26

### Added

- WebDAV `PROPPATCH`: `getlastmodified` and `Win32LastModifiedTime` set the
  modification time of the latest file version. The Windows attributes
  CarotDAV sends along (`Win32CreationTime`, `Win32LastAccessTime`,
  `Win32FileAttributes`) are accepted and ignored, so CarotDAV no longer
  reports a failed upload. Other properties are refused with 403.
- A startup warning when an explicit `sync: inline` or `strict: true` makes
  every write wait for a mirror that re-uploads.

### Changed

- **Breaking for configs without `sync`:** a file system that leaves out
  `sync` now gets `background` when a mirror re-uploads (another backend,
  Discord on either side, `mode: reupload`) and `inline` for Telegram to
  Telegram forwarding. Before, it was always `inline`, which made large
  uploads with a Discord mirror time out.
- The config generator writes `sync` only when it differs from that derived
  default, and `strict` only when true.
- GitHub metadata loads with a fixed number of API calls regardless of the
  folder count (one recursive tree call, folder dates cached on disk as
  `dir-timestamps-<repo>-<branch>.json`). Startup went from minutes to
  seconds on large trees.

### Fixed

- The Discord login is retried on server errors (5xx, refused connections)
  instead of taking the server down at startup; a rejected token still fails
  at once.
- A request for a path outside every file system (e.g. a browser's
  `/webdav/favicon.ico`) answers 404 instead of raising a `KeyError`.
- WebDAV reported the boot time as the modification date of every folder that
  contains files; the folder dates from the repository history are kept now.

## [0.2.0] - 2026-09-25

### Added

- Discord as a storage backend (`backends.discord`): a Discord channel can be
  a primary or a mirror store. Files are cut into parts of
  `max_file_size_bytes` (default 10 MB), several bot tokens are used in
  parallel, long descriptors travel as attachments, and transient failures
  are retried. Adapted from [dcfs](https://github.com/VulcanoSoftware/dcfs).
- Store abstraction and a new config layout: `backends`, named `stores` and
  `filesystems` with a `primary` and optional `mirrors`. Swapping primary and
  mirror is a config change. The tgfs layout (`private_file_channel`,
  `metadata` per channel, `redundancy`) is still read and translated on load.
- Cross-backend mirroring with replicas in the mirror's own part layout, and
  reads that fail over part by part across copies and replicas
  (`read_preference` sets the order).
- Background replication (`sync: background`) with a persistent queue
  (`replication_queue.json` in the data directory) and retries.
- Manager API: `GET /stores`, `GET /filesystems`, `GET /replication/queue`,
  `POST /replication/retry`.
- Frontend: the config generator edits stores and file systems and has an
  optional Discord section; the getting-started guide covers the Discord bot;
  the mini app has a "Mirrors and replication" dialog.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-09-24

### Added

- tgdcfs, bootstrapped from [tgfs](https://github.com/Xyvran/tgfs) at commit
  `7464666`: Telegram as storage with WebDAV and SFTP access, at-rest
  encryption and GitHub or Telegram metadata.
- Docker images `xyvran/tgdcfs` and `xyvran/tgdcfs-fe`; container user and
  data directory `/home/tgdcfs/.tgdcfs`.

### Changed

- Renamed from tgfs: package `tgdcfs`, environment variables `TGDCFS_*` and
  data directory `~/.tgdcfs`. The old `TGFS_*` variables and a top-level
  `tgfs:` config block still work with a deprecation warning.
- Files and metadata written by tgfs are read unchanged; the on-disk
  encryption format keeps its tgfs constants.
